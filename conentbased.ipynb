              " 'In The Threatening Storm, Kenneth M. Pollack, one of the worldâ\\x80\\x99s leading experts on Iraq, provides a masterly insiderâ\\x80\\x99s perspective on the crucial issues facing the United States as it moves toward a new confrontation with Saddam Hussein. For the past fifteen years, as an analyst on Iraq for the Central Intelligence Agency and the National Security Council, Kenneth Pollack has studied Saddam as closely as anyone else in the United States. In 1990, he was one of only three CIA analysts to predict the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. As the principal author of the CIAâ\\x80\\x99s history of Iraqi military strategy and operations during the Gulf War, Pollack gained rare insight into the methods and workings of what he believes to be the most brutal regime since Stalinist Russia. Examining all sides of the debate and bringing a keen eye to the military and geopolitical forces at work, Pollack ultimately comes to this controversial conclusion: through our own mistakes, the perfidy of others, and Saddamâ\\x80\\x99s cunning, the United States is left with few good policy options regarding Iraq. Increasingly, the option that makes the most sense is for the United States to launch a full-scale invasion, eradicate Saddamâ\\x80\\x99s weapons of mass destruction, and rebuild Iraq as a prosperous and stable societyâ\\x80\\x94for the good of the United States, the Iraqi people, and the entire region. Pollack believed for many years that the United States could prevent Saddam from threatening the stability of the Persian Gulf and the world through containmentâ\\x80\\x94a combination of sanctions and limited military operations. Here, Pollack explains why containment is no longer effective, and why other policies intended to deter Saddam ultimately pose a greater risk than confronting him now, before he gains possession of nuclear weapons and returns to his stated goal of dominating the Gulf region. â\\x80\\x9cIt is often said that war should be employed only in the last resort,â\\x80\\x9d Pollack writes. â\\x80\\x9cI reluctantly believe that in the case of the threat from Iraq, we have come to the last resort.â\\x80\\x9d Offering a view of the region that has the authority and force of an intelligence report, Pollack outlines what the leaders of neighboring Arab countries are thinking, what is necessary to gain their support for an invasion, how a successful U.S. operation would be mounted, what the likely costs would be, and how Saddam might react. He examines the state of Iraq todayâ\\x80\\x94its economy, its armed forces, its political system, the status of its weapons of mass destruction as best we understand them, and the terrifying security apparatus that keeps Saddam in power. Pollack also analyzes the last twenty years of relations between the United States and Iraq to explain how the two countries reached the unhappy standoff that currently prevails. Commanding in its insights and full of detailed information about how leaders on both sides will make their decisions, The Threatening Storm is an essential guide to understanding what may be the crucial foreign policy challenge of our time.',\n",

Serene on the surface, the ivy-clad, tree-lined campus gives few clues to the school\\'s history of special privileges, petty corruptions, and hidden allegiances.

In this fascinating account, however, we are told, for the first time, the hair-raising stories of the heroic British and American sailors, spies, and secret agents who put their lives on the line to provide the codebreakers with the materials they needed. Noted British journalist Hugh Sebag-Montefiore tracked down many of the surviving players in the Enigma drama, and these witnesses-some of them speaking on record for the first time-provide unforgettable firsthand accounts of the courageous men and women who faced death in order to capture vital codebooks from sinking ships and snatch them from under the noses of Nazi officials. In addition to these gripping stories, we learn fascinating new details about the genesis of the code and the feverish activities at Bletchley. Enigma is a spellbinding account of the brilliant feat of decryption that turned the tide of World War II.',\n",

Por si todavÃ\\xada quedaban dudas, Soldados de Salamina vuelve a confirmarnos que nos encontramos ante un novelista de fuste, Ã¡gil y de enorme astucia, capaz de arrastrar en su entusiasmo al lector mÃ¡s tibio. Un joven periodista topa por casualidad con una historia fascinante, y muy significativa, de la Guerra Civil espaÃ±ola, y se propone reconstruirla. Cuando las tropas republicanas se retiran hacia la frontera francesa, camino del exilio, en el desorden de la desbandada alguien toma la decisiÃ³n de fusilar a un grupo de presos franquistas. Entre ellos se halla Rafael SÃ¡nchez-Mazas , fundador e ideÃ³logo de Falange, quizÃ¡s uno de los responsables directos del conflicto fratricida. Pero SÃ¡nchez-Mazas no sÃ³lo logra escapar del fusilamiento colectivo, sino que, cuando los republicanos salen en su busca, un miliciano anÃ³nimo le encaÃ±ona y en el Ãºltimo momento le perdona la vida. Su buena estrella le permitirÃ¡ vivir emboscado hasta el final de la guerra, protegido por un grupo de campesinos de la regiÃ³n, aunque siempre recordarÃ¡ a aquel miliciano de extraÃ±a mirada que no lo delatÃ³. El narrador se propone desentraÃ±ar el secreto del enigmÃ¡tico SÃ¡nchez-Mazas, de su asombrosa aventura de guerra, pero sÃ³lo para acabar descubriendo, en un quiebro inesperado, que el significado de esta historia se encuentra donde menos podÃ\\xada esperarlo, Â«porque uno no encuentra lo que busca, sino lo que la realidad le entregaÂ». Como insiste en afirmar el propio narrador, Soldados de Salamina es un Â« relato real Â»; los lectores, sin embargo, lo leerÃ¡n como un thriller : Cercas nos embarca en una investigaciÃ³n de hechos histÃ³ricos que resulta apasionante porque su propÃ³sito es desentraÃ±ar un secreto que se resiste a ser desvelado, un secreto esencial que concierne no sÃ³lo a nuestro pasado mÃ¡s incÃ³modo , sino sobre todo a la condiciÃ³n humana.',\n",

This volume in the two volume series covers the four essential pieces for building a strong foundation: Accepting each other\\'s point of view as valid, (2) Fostering intimate connection by learning and using great speaking and listening skills, (3) Committing to respect each other 24/7 by productive management of upsets, and (4) Committing to each other and the relationship for life.

Illustrations are also shared from couples they taught in their classes and who were personally coached by Nancy. Marriage is skill-based.

Love returns, often greater than before, when new, effective ways of managing communication and conflict are learned and consistently applied. Giving up on a marriage because the love is gone is like selling a car because it ran out of gas!

              " 'A rough-and-tumble farce centered around a lively battle of the sexes, The Taming of the Shrew brims with action and bawdy humor. The unconventional romance between a lusty fortune-hunter and a bitter shrew unfolds to the accompaniment of witty, fast-paced dialogue and physical humor in this excellent introduction to Shakespearean comedy. The freebooter Petruchio arrives in Padua to hear of Katharina, a beautiful heiress whose waspish rants and caustic personality have repelled all attempts at courtship. Professing to admire a woman of spirit, Petruchio immediately sets about his wooing. The initial encounter between \"Kate\" and her wily suitor is spiked with impassioned exchanges of blows as well as jests. After a madcap wedding ceremony, the still-protesting Kate is whisked away to be \"killed with kindness\" and reborn as a loving wife. One of the Bard\\'s earliest and most popular plays, The Taming of the Shrew is rife with subplots involving his customary devices of disguise and mistaken identity. The vivid language, studded with elaborate puns, is an engaging complement to the play\\'s slapstick humor. Reprinted complete and unabridged in this inexpensive edition, The Taming of the Shrew will delight any reader with its wonderful wordplay and rollicking good spirits.',\n",

Accounts of their storybook affair were everywhere, and the world mourned together when they were killed in a car accident in Paris on August 30, 1997, yet this memoir is the first to get to the heart of the matter the way nothing else has. Tenderly written by Dodi's personal assistant and confidante for eight years, this book has the authority of the man who witnessed more of their relationship than anyone (he was with them 24 of those 37 days). Rather than expounding on the incomprehensibility of their untimely death, the focus is on their journey of life -- from the languorous days on the Jonikal (Fayed's fabulous yacht), where they danced to music from The English Patient, to the quiet moment when they ate dinner together on a couch, with their plates on their laps. The controversy surrounding the accident is addressed, as is the grieving and moving on of the family and friends of Diana and Dodi. What is most powerful about this special book, however, is its depiction of the love that made them so happy, and that made us all so sad when we lost them.\",\n",

Everything readers expect from Follett is here: intrigue, fast-paced action, and passionate romance. But what makes The Pillars of the Earth extraordinary is the timeâ\\x80\\x94the twelfth century; the placeâ\\x80\\x94feudal England; and the subjectâ\\x80\\x94the building of a glorious cathedral. Follett has re-created the crude, flamboyant England of the Middle Ages in every detail. The vast forests, the walled towns, the castles, and the monasteries become a familiar landscape. Against this richly imagined and intricately interwoven backdrop, filled with the ravages of war and the rhythms of daily life, the master storyteller draws the reader irresistibly into the intertwined lives of his charactersâ\\x80\\x94into their dreams, their labors, and their loves: Tom, the master builder; Aliena, the ravishingly beautiful noblewoman; Philip, the prior of Kingsbridge; Jack, the artist in stone; and Ellen, the woman of the forest who casts a terrifying curse. From humble stonemason to imperious monarch, each character is brought vividly to life. The building of the cathedral, with the almost eerie artistry of the unschooled stonemasons, is the center of the drama. Around the site of the construction, Follett weaves a story of betrayal, revenge, and love, which begins with the public hanging of an innocent man and ends with the humiliation of a king. At once a sensuous and endearing love story and an epic that shines with the fierce spirit of a passionate age, The Pillars of the Earth is without a doubt Ken Follett's masterpiece.\",\n",

Murder, Inc. is the book that exposed the Syndicate to the eyes of the world. First published in 1951, it rose to the top of the best-seller list, but later fell out-of-print. Now, here is a new edition of the classic that tells all about the great gangsters of the late '30s and '40s: Frank Costello, Louis â\\x80\\x9dLepkeâ\\x80\\x9d Buchalter, Meyer Lansky, Lucky Luciano, Buggsy Siegel, Johnny Torrio, Willie Sutton, Joey Adonis, Dutch Schultz. Here are the stories of how Pittsburgh Phil and Buggsy Goldstein literally set Puggy Feinstein on fire; how and why Kid Twist Reles sang to the D.A. for twelve straight days, confessing dozens of murders; how the killers' boss, Albert Anastasia, slipped through the arms of the law.From the highest levels of the U.S. government down to the lowest levels of street crime, the Syndicate infiltrated American life. Murder, Inc. tells how it was formally organized by the nation's ranking mob lords at the end of Prohibition to control all crime, from gambling to crooked politics to labor extortion and murder. It describes the carefully built organization with its board of governors and its kangaroo court, and shows how this massive and powerful organization was finally broken.For it was only from the murderers themselves that the truth could be learned. And no man was more qualified to tell the whole story than Burton Turkus, the Brooklyn assistant D.A. who listened to the killers' tales and who sent seven of them to the electric chair. Together with Sid Feder, a veteran journalist, they produced Murder, Inc., the definitive work on the most dangerous group of gangsters the law has ever known.\",\n",

The Schlegels are intellectuals, devotees of art and literature. The Wilcoxes are practical and materialistic, leading lives of \"telegrams and anger.\" When the elder Mrs. Wilcox dies and her family discovers she has left their country home-Howards End-to one of the Schlegel sisters, a crisis between the two families is precipitated that takes years to resolve. Written in 1910, Howards End is a symbolic exploration of the social, economic, and intellectual forces at work in England in the years preceding World War I, a time when vast social changes were occurring. In the Schlegels and the Wilcoxes, Forster perfectly embodies the competing idealism and materialism of the upper classes, while the conflict over the ownership of Howards End represents the struggle for possession of the country\\'s future. As critic Lionel Trilling once noted, the novel asks, \"Who shall inherit England?\" Forster refuses to take sides in this conflict. Instead he poses one of the book\\'s central questions: In a changing modern society, what should be the relation between the inner and outer life, between the world of the intellect and the world of business? Can they ever, as Forster urges, \"only connect\"?',\n",

When a body is discovered in the Lincoln Bedroom while the conferees are still in session, Eleanor Roosevelt knows that in order to keep the murder (as well as the Conference) a secret from the prying eyes of the press, not to mention foreign agents, she must solve it herself. Eleanor soon learns that the victim, Paul Weyrich, was a White House employee-one of the President's top advisors-who had been having an affair with his secretary. At first glance, it looks to be a crime of passion, instigated by Mr. Weyrich's refusal to marry his secretary. However, the deeper Eleanor digs into the case, the more clouded and uncertain the investigation becomes. Gradually, Eleanor discovers that the victim was part of a plot to assassinate the President, and she embarks on a daring plan to trap the assassin, using FDR as bait. Eleanor's skills will be put to the ultimate test as she must race to solve the mystery before the assassin strikes again. As the intrepid and charming Mrs. Roosevelt engages in her latest bit of Hawkshawing, readers are treated to all the historical re-creation and rich storytelling that have become hallmarks of the series. This satisfying wartime whodunit starring America's First Lady of Mystery is a warmly rewarding look at a fascinating era, and at a woman beloved by her family and her country-Eleanor Roosevelt.\",\n",

When young adults emerge at graduation from almost two decades of schooling, during which each step to take is clearly marked, they encounter an overwhelming number of choices regarding their careers, finances, homes, and social networks. Confronted by an often shattering whirlwind of new responsibilities, new liberties, and new options, they feel helpless, panicked, indecisive, and apprehensive. Quarterlife Crisis is the first book to document this phenomenon and offer insightful advice on smoothly navigating the challenging transition from childhood to adulthood, from school to the world beyond. It includes the personal stories of more than one hundred twentysomethings who describe their struggles to carve out personal identities; to cope with their fears of failure; to face making choices rather than avoiding them; and to balance all the demanding aspects of personal and professional life. From \"What do all my doubts mean?\" to \"How do I know if the decisions I\\'m making are right?\" this book compellingly addresses the hardest questions facing young adults today.',\n",

Itâ\\x80\\x99s four oâ\\x80\\x99clock, and she hasnâ\\x80\\x99t been allowed to eat anything all day. Her mother, on the other hand, seems curiously excited. She\\'s about to suggest open-heart surgery on her child to \"get to the bottom of this.\" She checks her teeth for lipstick and, as the doctor enters, shoots the girl a warning glance. This child will not ruin her plans. Sickened From early childhood, Julie Gregory was continually X-rayed, medicated, and operated onâ\\x80\\x94in the vain pursuit of an illness that was created in her motherâ\\x80\\x99s mind. Munchausen by proxy (MBP) is the worldâ\\x80\\x99s most hidden and dangerous form of child abuse, in which the caretakerâ\\x80\\x94almost always the motherâ\\x80\\x94invents or induces symptoms in her child because she craves the attention of medical professionals. Many MBP children die, but Julie Gregory not only survived, she escaped the powerful orbit of her mother\\'s madness and rebuilt her identity as a vibrant, healthy young woman. Sickened is a remarkable memoir that speaks in an original and distinctive Midwestern voice, rising to indelible scenes in prose of scathing beauty and fierce humor.

Now this master of the drama of daily life offers readers a different kind of boy-meets-girl tale, by turns frank and playful, that ponders the question: Can love conquer marriage? It is True Dickinson's forty-third birthday, and her best friends have gathered on this snowy night in Cape Cod at a trendy neighborhood restaurant to celebrate. True has never felt more alone. It's been eight years since the death of her husband, a pilot who, ironically, died in a car crash, leaving her to raise their son on her own. Both her son and her small business are thriving, and True's life is full. The success of her company, the love of her friends, and the proximity of her mother (for better and for worse) leave her with very little time for reflection, but if not now, when? Coming up on forty-three makes True realize that there is an empty space in her life that friends and family cannot fill. She feels her youth and beauty slipping away, and the possibility for romance has never seemed more remote. But everything will change the moment True and her beloved assistant, Isabelle, slide into a snow-filled ditch on the drive home. Saved by a young man she met earlier at the restaurant, True comes face-to- face with the opportunity to let love back into her life -- that is, if she can overcome her own fears, and if these two spirits can find a way to tame each other's wild hearts and to curb their supremely independent natures.

Ostensibly a racy autobiography of a young rogue and his succession of masters, in reality it is a comical and caustic expose of sixteenth century Spanish society, and especially the Church. Rowland's translation exploited the propaganda potential of the text at a time when England and Spain drifted into open war. Lazarillo de Tormes is a key Renaissance humanist text and a formative influence upon European rogue literature and the evolution of realist prose fiction. Keith Whitlock has written a full introduction from a European perspective and provided a comprehensive annotation of the Tudor English. 176p\",\n",

The hacker\\'s code name was \"Hunter\" -- a mystery invader hiding inside a twisting electronic labyrinth, breaking into U.S. computer systems and stealing sensitive military and security information. Stoll began a one-man hunt of his own, spying on the spy -- and plunged into an incredible international probe that finally gained the attention of top U.S. counterintelligence agents. The Cuckoo\\'s Egg is his wild and suspenseful true story -- a year of deception, broken codes, satellites, missile bases, and the ultimate sting operation -- and how one ingenious American trapped a spy ring paid in cash and cocaine, and reporting to the KGB.',\n",

The teachers' own words in the autobiographical chapters offer powerful testimony supporting approaches to literacy that encourage and support the job of reading and writing, rather than pedantic and meaningless curriculum methods that emphasize isolated skills and drills. The topic is very significant. There is currently a backlash against the whole language approach, which through the years has had other titles but has always emphasized the creative, responsive teaching described in meaningful, individual, integrated and joyful approaches to the teaching of reading and writing. This book could have a positive influence on the current discussions about the teaching of literacy.\",\n",

He takes you on the greatest, longest date of your life. He swears he loves cats and cuddling. And his apartment is so clean. He just might be the One. Then he doesn\\'t call, doesn\\'t write. He sees you coming down the street and he hides behind a tree. He\\'s a cad. And this is his story. After all the girl\\'s guides to sex in the city, here -- at last -- is the view from the other side of the bed. In Cad: Confessions of Toxic Bachelor, Rick Marin offers himself up for an in-depth look at man\\'s superficial nature. At 28, a brief, doomed first marriage thrusts him back into Bachelor Hell. A journalist as eager to make it in Manhattan as with its female population, our emotionally myopic hero can never seem to tell if the woman in front of him is too crazy or too sane, until she gets too close. Falling out of love as often as he falls in, he vows more than once to clean up his act, only to relapse into another bender of beauties, blow-offs and bad behavior -- all in desperate pursuit of the woman who can redeem him. In this rollicking, frequently insensitive and ultimately poignant memoir, Marin proves a master of the light touch even in his darkest hours. Part Hugh Hefner, part Hugh Grant, his tale is a rake\\'s progress (in spite of himself) from incorrigible cad to reconstructed romantic. It is one man\\'s story, but many men will read it as their own. And for any woman who has ever wondered, \"What was he thinking\" This is what he was thinking.',\n",
